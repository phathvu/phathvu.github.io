In February 2024, I had the incredible honor of embarking on an onsite trip to Switzerland with my team. This was our very first opportunity to visit this beautiful country, renowned for its breathtaking landscapes and warm, welcoming people. The trip was truly a milestone for our team and marked a significant chapter in our journey as software engineers.

Our destination was the headquarters of [Mobiliar](https://www.mobiliar.ch/), one of the largest and most prestigious insurance companies in Switzerland. The four of us traveled there to participate in our first-ever PI Planning session. It was a remarkable experience to work side by side with colleagues at Mobiliar’s office, where collaboration and innovation thrived in such an inspiring environment.

We were fortunate to meet some truly amazing people during our time at Mobiliar. Not only were they incredibly supportive in guiding us through our tasks and responsibilities, but they also went out of their way to make our weekends enjoyable. Whether it was exploring the local sights, tasting Swiss delicacies, or simply exchanging stories, their warmth and hospitality left a lasting impression on us.

This trip was more than just a professional engagement; it was a chance to learn, grow, and build unforgettable memories. We gained invaluable insights, strengthened our teamwork, and brought back experiences that continue to inspire us every day. It’s a chapter we’ll always cherish, a reminder of the beauty of collaboration and the bonds that can form even across continents.
